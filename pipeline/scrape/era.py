"""Fetch missing regular-meeting HTML from August 2015 to the current month.

Existing raw texts are preserved. This is not a complete reconstruction:
PDF backfill and the separately sourced emergency documents are also needed.

The MPC met monthly through 2015, then moved to 8 meetings/year ("Super
Thursday") from 2016 onward. Rather than hardcode which months have a
meeting, this just tries every month in the range and tolerates 404s for
months with no meeting.

Governed by DECISIONS.md: 2026-07-11 (era corpus - schedule discovered by
trying, two URL slug patterns, suspect-parse threshold).

Run on your own machine:

    This was a hardcoded constant that had to be bumped by hand every ingest,

    was not. The scraper's end cannot be derived from the corpus - extending
    the corpus is its whole job - so it derives from the clock instead, and
    the existing 404 tolerance handles months with no meeting.
