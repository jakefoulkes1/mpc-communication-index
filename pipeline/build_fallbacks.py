"""Regenerates every static fallback block and every inline figure on every
published surface - index.html, methodology.html and README.md - from the
data files.

Site layer, additive: reads the data files the front-end fetches and rewrites
two kinds of marked region.

  <!-- fallback:NAME -->...<!-- /fallback:NAME -->   a whole block of markup
  <!-- fig:NAME -->...<!-- /fig:NAME -->             one figure inside prose

The block regions are what a reader sees if the fetch fails or JavaScript
never runs; the JS overwrites them on success. The figure regions are prose
that JavaScript never touches - the sentence is the author's, the number in
it is the data's. methodology.html runs no JavaScript at all, and README.md
is Markdown (which tolerates HTML comments), so on those two surfaces every
number is a region or it is not a figure.

Nothing here is retyped. Block regions are built from the data file the
front-end would have fetched, using the same formatting rules index.html's
own JS uses; figure regions come from pipeline/site_figures.py, which is also
what the tests read. pipeline/tests/test_static_fallback.py and
pipeline/tests/test_site_figures.py fail until this has been re-run.

Run it after any rebuild of index.json, ladder_v1.json, inference_v1.json,
site_context.json, annotations.json, track_record.json or a prediction file,
and after a new lock-* file is written: the prediction file on display is
the newest lock-*, derived here rather than edited into the page.
