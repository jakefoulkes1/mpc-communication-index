"""Build data/index.json from cached raw documents.

Documents are discovered over data/raw/*.txt (one file per scraped meeting,
named YYYY-MM-minutes.txt by pipeline/scrape/era.py). For each document:
- meeting_end is parsed from the "At its meeting ending on <date>..." sentence.
- published is meeting_end + 1 day, the announcement-date rule for this era
  (see DECISIONS.md).
- decision and vote are parsed from the same sentence's "voted (by a majority
  of A-B | unanimously) to <decision clause>" construction.
Any field that doesn't parse is left null and logged - never guessed.
