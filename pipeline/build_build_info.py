"""Builds data/build_info.json: when the site was last updated, taken from
git rather than from a hand-typed date.

Site layer, additive: reads nothing but `git log`, writes one NEW json file,
touches no existing schema and nothing under data/predictions/.

The stamp names the commit that was HEAD when this script ran, so the
correct order on a release day is: commit the content, then run this, then
commit data/build_info.json and the rewritten stamps on their own. That
second commit changes no prose, so the stamp always points at the commit the
reader is actually looking at. See DECISIONS.md, 2026-07-30.

As well as the json, this rewrites the static `<!-- fallback:buildinfo -->`
stamp in each HTML page - index.html, which also refreshes it by fetch, and
methodology.html and episodes.html, which run no JavaScript and have only
the static one (episodes.html joined on 2026-10-05). They
are rewritten here rather than by hand because
pipeline/tests/test_static_fallback.py asserts they match the json, and a
hand-edit is exactly the step that gets forgotten.

Run:  python -m pipeline.build_build_info
