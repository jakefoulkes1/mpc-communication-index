"""Contract test: the figures hard-coded into the static HTML must still
match the JSON they were generated from.

index.html ships with the current ladder table and the locked call's key
figures built into the markup, so a reader whose fetch fails - or who has
JavaScript off entirely - sees real numbers instead of "Loading...". That
fallback is a copy, and copies rot. This test regenerates every fallback
string from the JSON, using the same formatting rules index.html's own JS
uses, and asserts each one appears inside the fallback markers.

If this fails, the fix is to regenerate the fallback markup from the JSON -
never to retype a figure by hand. See DECISIONS.md, 2026-07-30.
