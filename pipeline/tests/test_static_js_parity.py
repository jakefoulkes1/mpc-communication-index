"""Browser tests: what the page actually renders, both ways and on paper.

Parity: the built-in (no-JavaScript) text of every section must agree with
what the JavaScript renders from the same data.

Every JS-rendered section of index.html ships with a static fallback
generated from the same JSON by pipeline/build_fallbacks.py. The two are
written by different languages with different formatting habits, and they
have disagreed before: on 2026-08-30 the built-in call card read "25.0bp"
where the script rendered "25bp". This test renders the page both ways in a
real browser and diffs the text of every figure-bearing element.

The browser's time zone is deliberately set west of Greenwich: a bare ISO
date parsed as UTC midnight is the previous evening in California, which is
how a date-only string can render a day early - the fmtDate() fix of
2026-09-02.

Needs Playwright with Chromium (pip install playwright; playwright install
chromium). Skips cleanly when either is absent locally; CI installs both.
Run it before every publish. Serves the
repository from an ephemeral localhost port; no live network calls.
