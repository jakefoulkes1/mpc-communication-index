"""The episode notes moved to their own page on 2026-09-02. This is what
that move promised.

index.html used to carry every note whole - 1,324 words, 37% of the front
page. The notes are now published at episodes.html and the front page keeps
an index to them: title, date, the note's own opening two sentences, and a
link. Three things could quietly break that and did not fail anything:

  1. a note published in data/annotations.json but not rendered on
     episodes.html, so its anchor 404s from the front page;
  2. an episode body creeping back onto index.html;
  3. a standfirst that is not the note's own words - a summary written on
     the front page and never checked against what it stands for.

The link into the essay from the track record moved with it, so the fourth
check is that no in-page #episode- anchor is left on index.html.

See DECISIONS.md, 2026-09-17 (front-page structure pass, landed).
