"""No placeholder may reach a published surface.

The site carried "Draft — JF to revise" badges and <!-- DRAFT: JF to revise -->
comments through August 2026 by design: prose drafted in earlier passes was
marked for the author. Stage 2 of the September pass replaced every one of
them. This test fails the suite if any marker comes back, on any surface a
reader can see: both pages, the README, the published episodes and their
source markdown.

The `.draft-note` CSS rule was the project's device for the badge; a
surface that uses the class is a surface with a draft on it.

See DECISIONS.md, 2026-09-02 (Stage 2).
