"""Builds data/market_history.csv: v1 OIS-based proxy {cut, hold, hike}
probabilities for every meeting in the text corpus (Aug 2015-present),
from the historical OIS forward curve + SONIA, using the same convention
as the live dry-run card (pipeline/predict/market_probs.py, LOCK_OFFSET_DAYS
= 3 days after the meeting - see DECISIONS.md, 2026-07-11).

`lock_date` is a valuation date, NOT a verified public-availability cutoff:
announcement - LOCK_DATE_OFFSET_DAYS (2) calendar days; if
that isn't a trading day (weekend/holiday - simply absent from the data),
walks back to the nearest one that is, logged.

Historical files can be revised and release lags are not reconstructed.
All currently published rows request a five-day maturity below the first
one-month node, so endpoint clipping applies. Preserve v1 results; a
release-aware, meeting-specific benchmark needs a separate version.
See DECISIONS.md 2026-10-10.

`scheduled` (bool): False for special_minutes (emergency meetings, e.g.
the March 2020 Covid cuts) - at "lock time" nobody could have registered
a forecast for a meeting whose existence wasn't yet announced, so these
can't be treated as ordinary pre-registered forecasts. True for every
regular minutes document. See DECISIONS.md, 2026-07-11.
