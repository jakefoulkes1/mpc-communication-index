## The question

Does the tone of the Bank of England Monetary Policy Committee's published
minutes carry information about the next Bank Rate decision beyond what
financial markets already price into the OIS/SONIA curve? Every MPC minutes
document from <!-- fig:corpus_start_month -->August 2015<!-- /fig:corpus_start_month --> to
<!-- fig:corpus_end_month -->September 2026<!-- /fig:corpus_end_month -->
(<!-- fig:corpus_n -->96<!-- /fig:corpus_n --> documents) is scored with the
Apel & Blix Grimaldi (2012) hawkish/dovish dictionary, adapting its method
to English-language Bank of England minutes. The benchmark is an OIS-based
proxy: a two-state probability mapping of the Bank's published forward curve.
Models that add the
tone index are evaluated against that benchmark in an expanding-window
backtest, and — going forward — in pre-registered probabilistic calls locked
and timestamped before each announcement and scored after it, including the
misses. Failure to beat this proxy is a result about these models, this
dictionary and this sample. It does not establish that markets already
price all communication or that communication has no value.

**Benchmark caveats:** historical reads clip to the first one-month node;
the requested post-meeting offset has no effect on those rows. The backtest
uses valuation-dated archives, not verified point-in-time public releases.
Numerical v1 results are preserved. See the methodology and the forward-only
correction in DECISIONS.md dated 2026-10-10.

## How it works

Five stages: scrape → score → benchmark → lock → score.

## Headline results

Every figure below is written by `pipeline/build_fallbacks.py` from
[data/ladder_v1.json](data/ladder_v1.json) and
[data/inference_v1.json](data/inference_v1.json), which are the source of
truth; `pipeline/tests/test_site_figures.py` fails if this file drifts from
them. Rounding: scores to 4 decimal places, coefficients and t-statistics
to 2, p-values to 4.

**Benchmark ladder** — scheduled meetings only, expanding-window evaluation
from <!-- fig:eval_start -->1 January 2019<!-- /fig:eval_start -->
(<!-- fig:n_scheduled -->62<!-- /fig:n_scheduled --> meetings; the
<!-- fig:n_specials -->2<!-- /fig:n_specials --> March 2020 emergency meetings
are reported separately in the JSON as a robustness line). Lower Brier / log
score is better; positive skill vs L1 would mean beating the market.

<!-- fallback:readme_ladder -->
| Model | Description | Mean Brier | Mean log score | Skill vs L1 | n |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| L0 | always hold | 0.6452 | 6.6849 | — | 62 |
| L1 | market-only (OIS-implied, two-state ±25bp) | 0.0904 | 0.1470 | reference | 62 |
| L2 | ordered logit on the market-implied change | 0.0980 | 0.1660 | −0.0841 | 62 |
| L3 | L2 + lagged tone index + lagged vote skew | 0.1469 | 0.2599 | −0.6250 | 62 |
| L4 | member-level transition simulation, blended with market | 0.1592 | 0.2553 | −0.7611 | 62 |
<!-- /fallback:readme_ladder -->

No model that adds the tone index beats the market-only benchmark (L1) in
this backtest.

**Spec 3** — <!-- fallback:readme_spec3 -->Regressing each meeting's market surprise on the *previous* meeting's index (OLS, Newey–West standard errors, 4 lags, n=93 scheduled meetings): coefficient **−2.08** (t = −2.08, **p = 0.0375**). On the post-hiking-cycle subsample (from 1 September 2023, n=25) the estimate has the same sign but is not statistically distinguishable from zero: coefficient −2.97 (t = −1.35, p = 0.1777). Spec 2, an ordered-logit likelihood-ratio test on the discrete decision, finds no statistically significant improvement: LR = 0.4556, p = 0.4997. Coefficients and t-statistics are rounded to 2 decimal places and p-values to 4; full precision is in `data/inference_v1.json`.<!-- /fallback:readme_spec3 -->
The two specifications disagree; both are reported.

<!-- fallback:readme_lock -->**Latest pre-registered lock: 16 September 2026, 17:20:49 UTC, for the 17 September 2026 announcement** (tag `lock-2026-09`). Locked calls so far: 2. Next lock: 3 November 2026, for the 5 November 2026 announcement.<!-- /fallback:readme_lock -->
Files under `data/predictions/lock-*` are permanent once written, misses
included.

## Quickstart

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pytest                            # full suite, no live network calls
python -m http.server 8000        # then open http://localhost:8000
```

The site must be viewed over http://, not file:// — the page fetches
`data/*.json`. Rebuilding the derived data (`python -m pipeline.build_index`
and the other `pipeline.build_*` modules) requires the raw source cache,
which is local-only (see below). See [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) for scraping your
own copy.

## Limitations

Documented limitations — risk premia embedded in OIS forwards, sparse
lexicon hits per document, the lexicon's 2012 vintage, small n, and the
disagreement between Spec 2 and Spec 3 — are listed factually on the
[methodology page](https://jakefoulkes1.github.io/mpc-communication-index/methodology.html#limitations),
each traceable to a dated entry in [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md).

## Notes

Not investment advice. Source documents © Bank of England, linked, not
republished; raw texts stay in a local gitignored cache and only derived
scores and hashes are published.
